Charles' Video Creation Notes and Tools (For Linux)

These tools are what I use for my video creation.  They include mostly scripts that use avconv and mencoder, but also a some toos like "boxer."

Boxer: Use boxer to highlight on the screen capture areas, i.e. if you are using framegrab480, type boxer 0 0 720 480 to draw a box around the capture area.  Build boxer and copy it to your /usr/local/bin/ folder.

For actual video editing, I use kdenlive. Project settings I usually use as 720p30, video export for youtube, MP4/MP3 Audio, 18mbit/s video, 160kbit/s audio.
